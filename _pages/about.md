Welcome! 
I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Economics at HEC Paris, under the supervision of [Gaetano Gaballo](https://sites.google.com/view/ggaballo).

I am interested in topics at the intersection of macroeconomics and Finance. In particular, I am investigating firms' credit relationships with both bank and non banks lenders, and with a focus on the loan market.

I was a visiting student at UPenn in fall 2024, and a summer research graduate program participant at the European Central Bank in summer 2025.

**Quantifying the role of imperfect competition and asymmetric information in bank pricing: evidence from loan rate dispersion**

I investigate the dispersion in borrowing costs between firms as symptomatic of market frictions. In particular, I
 focus on imperfect competition and asymmetric information as the sources of this dispersion, and ask to what ex
tent they are reflected in lendersâ€™ pricing strategies. Distinguishing between the two has very different implication
 on the assessment of market efficiency and on policy implications. In the context of the french bank loan market, I
 start by documenting rate dispersion among similar firms and credit types. I characterize the distribution of rate
 premia and show that is varies over time and responds to monetary policy shocks. I also show that rate premia
 contain forward information, namely there is correlation between paying a higher premia and having an ex-post
 higher default probability, which is consistent with both frictions. Then, I move to specifying the identification
 strategy, and the last step will be to quantify to which extent these frictions enter the pricing strategy of banks
 by calibrating a model to the data.

**Banks, Peer-to-Peer lending platforms and the transmission of monetary policy: loan-level
evidence from France,**
 with *Mattia Girotti* (Banque de France) and *Andrea Polo* (LUISS,
Rome)
Business lending practices in Europe are quickly evolving as more digital and AI platforms
enter the corporate credit market, traditionally dominated by banks. Using loan level data from
France, we analyse the different lending behaviour of banks and peer to peer platforms to firms
in response to high-frequency monetary policy shocks.
