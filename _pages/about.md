#Getting started
#======
Welcome! 

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at HEC Paris, under the supervision of [Gaetano Gaballo](https://sites.google.com/view/ggaballo). 

My research interests lies at the intersection of macroeconomics and finance. I am particularly interested in studying firms' financing conditions and credit relationships, both with banks and non bank lenders.  

I was a visiting student in UPenn in fall 2024, and a participant of the summer graduate program at the European Central Bank in the Research Department.
