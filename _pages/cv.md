Job Market Paper
======

I investigate the dispersion in borrowing costs between firms as symptomatic of market frictions. In particular, I focus on imperfect competition and asymmetric information as the sources of this dispersion, and ask to what ex tent they are reflected in lendersâ€™ pricing strategies. Distinguishing between the two has very different implication on the assessment of market efficiency and on policy implications. In the context of the french bank loan market, I start by documenting rate dispersion among similar firms and credit types. I characterize the distribution of rate premia and show that is varies over time and responds to monetary policy shocks. I also show that rate premia contain forward information, namely there is correlation between paying a higher premia and having an ex-post higher default probability, which is consistent with both frictions. Then, I move to specifying the identification strategy, and the last step will be to quantify to which extent these frictions enter the pricing strategy of banks by calibrating a model to the data.
